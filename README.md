# Predicting Stroke
## Steven Phillips
### Problem:
The problem explored in this project is to discover which of several features increase the likelihood of stroke.
### Data:
The data used for this project originates from:
https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/

The data items include several features including: body mass index, age, marital status, average glucose level, smoking status, work type, gender, and the presence or heart disease or hypertension.
## Methods
The data were prepared by eliminating duplicates and focusing on age, smoking status, presence of heart disease and hypertension.
## Results 
This first image showcases correlations between numeric variables.

## Model
The model chosen is a ***** with the hyperparameter *** tuned to ***.
The metrics for evaluation of our optimized ***** Model of *** on our test data are: ****
## Recommendations
The ** score of our model is ***, explaining *** percent of the variability in our target data.
## Limitations & Next Steps
This ** score of 0*** is ***, but was the highest of the models explored.  Additional data should be gathered on additional feautures that may provide more accurate predictions.
